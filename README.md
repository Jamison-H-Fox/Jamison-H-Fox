## Hi, I'm Jamison

### Full stack developer

I like startups because you can go fast. 

I like fullstack because you get to know your product on a really intimate level.

I like frontend because there's a lot of magic.

I like backend because there's less magic.

I like mountains because there's no wifi in them.

I like my job because I work with people who are smarter than I am.
