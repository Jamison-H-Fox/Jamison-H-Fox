## Hi, I'm Jamison

### Full stack developer

I've spent most of my adult life working in sales. Over time it became hard for me to push products that I felt were flawed or meaningless for the consumer, and I felt myself dreading work every day. I started to feel that I'd like to create a thing rather than just sell it.

Excellence is important to me. I want to build things that will matter to people and make their impact in the world greater. The decision to become a software developer was natural, and for the first time in a long time I'm excited about what I do for a living. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website building tool to help small business owners quickly and painlessly get online for the first time
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UX basic principles to build something people will love using and Advanced React to get it on the page
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for my first paid position as a web developer

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm super double jointed. I'll show you if you interview me. :)
