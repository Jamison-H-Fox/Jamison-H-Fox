## Hi, I'm Jamison

### Full stack developer

- I like startups because they go fast. 

- I like fullstack because you get to know your product on an intimate level.

- I like frontend because there's a lot of magic.

- I like backend because there's less magic.

- I like mountains because there's no wifi.

- I like my job because I work with smart people.
